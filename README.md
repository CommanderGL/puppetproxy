# PuppetProxy

A live stream to a puppeteer instance running on a server. Designed for unblocking websites on school chromebooks.

## For Schools

If you want to block this feel free to as this is more of a proof of concept and tends to have really bad performance. This more directed towards students who want to develop code and show off things like self-hosted nextcloud instances.
